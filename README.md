This is personal portfolio, where I post my current resume as well as the latest projects I've been working on. The site is located at [https://jazevedo.me](https://jazevedo.me), and is built using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) + [React](https://reactjs.org) for static site generation.

## Setup

After cloning the repository, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)/npm installed and run the following commands in the repository root:

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
npm install
```

Once both the project's dependencies as well as the gatsby CLI have been installed, you can either run the website on a development test server or build the entire site to production-ready static HTML/CSS/JS:

### Development Server

```
gatsby develop
```

Then, open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

### Build to Static HTML

```
gatsby build
```

The built files should reside at `repo_root/public`
