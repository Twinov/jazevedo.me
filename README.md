# Personal Portfolio Site

This is where I post my current resume and the latest projects I've worked on. The site is located at [https://jazevedo.me](https://jazevedo.me), and is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for static content management.

## Setup

The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so simply follow the [instructions from the Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) depending on your operating system. Once installed, run

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

to build the site into the `_site/` directory, or start an integrated webserver and build the site using

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The server can then be accessed at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)
