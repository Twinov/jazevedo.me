lead: "The frontend is built with Vue.js and HTML Canvases, leveraging the Javascript canvas library <a href=\"https://konvajs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Konva</a>, while the backend is built with Play Framework and Akka in Scala.

## Role

For this project, my primary role on the team was lead backend engineer, and I also ended up
configuring the containerized deployment of our application on a variety of platforms (both
within orchestration environments and standalone). While I did contribute to the frontend of
our application, especially where it concerns overall architecture and program structure, the
majority of my contributions were either to the backend or for deployment.

{% include header.html level="h4" icon="fas fa-database" text="Backend" %}

Over the course of the project, I was responsible for developing the structure of the application's
backend, which, according to the project's guidelines, was a
[Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/){:rel="noopener" target="_blank"} application written
in Scala. In addition, we made heavy use of a variety of libraries such as:

- [Akka Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/index.html){:rel="noopener" target="_blank"}
  /[Actors](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/index-actors.html){:rel="noopener" target="_blank"}
to manage Websocket connections
- [Google Guice](https://github.com/google/guice){:rel="noopener" target="_blank"} to
provide runtime dependency injection
- [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine){:rel="noopener" target="_blank"} for high
performance caching on the JVM

##### Build Pipeline

A variety of Python, Batchfile, and Bash scripts were made to handle the process of building from
compilation to deployment. Altogether, they automated performing the following high-level tasks:

1. Building the map data from SVG to JSON
2. Building the frontend using Webpack/Vue CLI
3. Building the backend using sbt and packaging it to a zip
4. Unzipping the built archive and configuring the start script
5. Adding additional files, such as data/documentation files
6. Building, tagging, and pushing the Docker image

{% include header.html level="h4" icon="fab fa-docker" text="Deployment" %}

When it came to running our project in a production environment, I settled on using a Docker
container based on an [Alpine image](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk){:rel="noopener" target="_blank"}
that came preloaded with the JRE 8. Initially, I configured deployment for
[Redhat's OpenShift Online](https://www.openshift.com/products/online/){:rel="noopener" target="_blank"}
before switching to [Microsoft's AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/){:rel="noopener" target="_blank"},
both of which use Kubernetes for orchestration.

While these worked well, they proved to be inadequate for long-term deployment, with even
short term costs proving to be substantial. With this in mind, the final solution ended
up being a vanilla Docker environment running on a bare metal Ubuntu server. Additionally,
in order to support HTTPS in this environment, I ended up using an [Nginx container acting as
a reverse proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy){:rel="noopener" target="_blank"}
to handle SSL termination.
