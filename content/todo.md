# TODO

## Ideas

- Break down home page by sections (Design, programming projects), add this metadata to projects:
  - Design
    - Graphic Design
    - Motion Graphics
    - 3D Modeling
  - Development
    - Web (Frontend) Dev
    - Backend (Server) Dev
    - Game Dev
    - Desktop App Dev
    - Systems Dev
    - General Dev
- Add better design for content on main page (better headings?)
- Add social media images rendered using Gatsby?
consider adding context field for each project (i.e high school, undergrad, etc.)
- Consider using different format for projects (maybe Markdoc? https://markdoc.dev/) it would even be fun to write a rust parser
