# Contact

My name is Joseph, and I'm a second-year computer science student at Georgia Tech specializing in full stack development and web applications. I enjoy working on projects that focus on building smooth UI design as well as structured and efficient developer toolchains. I can be contacted through email (preferred) as well as LinkedIn.
