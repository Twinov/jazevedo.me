description: Java iterative physics simulator for exploring the historic Brachistochrone Problem originally posed by Johann Bernoulli in 1696
lead: "Iterative calculus-based simulation with accompanying <a href=\"https://www.lwjgl.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenGL-powered</a> graphics display program designed to verify relative performance of different solutions to the historic <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BrachistochroneProblem.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Brachistochrone problem</a>. Corresponding report paper/poster presentation was made in LaTex which gives results and a mathematical explanation of a rigorous solution."
